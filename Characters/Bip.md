# Bip

If you make a prop of him, give a yellow antenna.

Bip is a [[Mottekian]] miner who met with the [[Plik]]s and learned their language. He struck a deal with them to set up and maintain hidden taps of [[Bubbubbub]] that go downward instead into the mine.

He lives in the [[Vault]], but may be encountered whenever you feel it's time to start wrapping up.

He does not care at all about the general welfare of the Mottekians and is motivated by material gain.

When confronted, he may try to bribe the PC, offering a steady stream of wealth.
