# Space Pirates

They've gathered at this abandoned mine to hideout. They have captured [[Bip]] without understanding his deal with the [[Plik]]s. They're merely happy to have taken 39 [[Wire]] from him. They don't know about his [[Vault]].

Space Pirate table:

1: Space Cyclops
2: Ninja
3-5: Thri-Kreen
6-8: Wirons

## Space Cyclops

Like [Pom Pom Monster](https://jimkang.com/weblog/articles/dnd-with-a-kid/pom-pom-dungeon/#pom-pom-monster) without Pom Poms.

The Space Cyclopses and Ninja are rivals for informal leadership of the Space Pirates.

The Wirons are alien to Mottek. They hail from an icy planet and communicate only in writing to non-Wirons. They look sort of like metal curtain hooks. They conduct electricity and are stunned by it.
