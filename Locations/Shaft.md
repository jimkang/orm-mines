# Shaft

It used to have an elevator to carry out the [[Bubbubbub]]. It's stuck at the top and can be unlodged but may crush those below it.

With a DC 15 DEX check and a normal Climbing check, the PC can climb around the car and reach the top of the shaft.

The elevator car has a hole in the floor and contains a random [[Treasure table]] item.
