# Dungeon map

At every location, if there isn't already a character there, there is a 1d4 chance (or if there's a lull in the game) of a [[Random character table]] encounter.

**G** indicates a locked door that requires a green [[cardkey]].
**B** indicates a locked door that requires a blue [[cardkey]].
**R** indicates a locked door that requires a red [[cardkey]].
