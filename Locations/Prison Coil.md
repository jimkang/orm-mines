# Prison Coil

This is a room that contains just this prison coil.

If they are in it, the PC can make a STR check DC 15 to burst out completely. Or they can make a STR check DC 10 to open it just enough to slip out with a DEX check DC 12. Failure gets them stuck with 1d3 damage.

If the [[Space Pirates]] are the ones who put the PC in the coil, they will occasionally come into the room to check on the coil. However, it easy to hear them coming.

The ceiling contains a hidden chamber. One way to reach it is to stand the coil on its end, then stand on the coil.
