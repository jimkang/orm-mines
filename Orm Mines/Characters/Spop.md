# Spop

Spop is a [[Mottekian]] who has run the [[Orm Outpost]] both before the mines shut down (between 3-6 months ago).

What he thinks he knows:

- The mine started running out of [[Bubbubbub]] and miners started leaving.
- [[Bip]] was a miner captured by the [[Plik]]s.
- There's a [[Vault]] in the mines, where Orm kept the best treasure from the mines.
- There's a big monster in there that can be stunned by electricity.
