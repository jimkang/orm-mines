# What is Orm Mines for

This was designed as a solo adventure for a player, age 7, with a 4th level character. It's part of the campaign started with [Pom Pom Dungeon](https://jimkang.com/weblog/articles/dnd-with-a-kid/pom-pom-dungeon/). It was written in a few hours and playtested exactly once.

The player requested an adventure that took place on another planet, so the adventure is set on a planet called Mottek, and has sci-fi tropes like [[Repulsor pack]]s and devices powered by energy sources.

We play 5E D&D, but this is fairly stat-light, so I imagine you could fit it to a lot of systems or just pick out anything you like and put it in your own adventure.

# Start

[[Oomoo]], the Mayor's friend from Mottek got a message from her planet about [[Orm Mines (overview)]] It is no longer producing [[Bubbubbub]], which the [[Mottekian]]s need to make their [[Mottekian spossip]]s.

She needs a hero to go to Mottek to find out why. She offers 10 units of [[Wire]] to get them started.

She will drop the PC off at [[Orm Outpost]].

# Running the game

The main quest is helping the [[Mottekian]]s find out what happened to the [[Bubbubbub]]. Along the way there are [[Space Pirates]] to avoid, trick, or fight. The reason the [[Bubbubbub]] is gone lies with [[Bip]], and the cause may not be what a younger player expects. There are many ways they could resolve this, and you, the DM, should be flexible about it.

## Map

The map is at [[Orm Mines (overview)]].

## Props

This is a very prop-heavy adventure. Many locations and characters will have a picture of a prop to represent it.

You can either:

- Find something like it lying around and use that
- Just don't use the prop and do traditional D&D Theater of the Mind if they player is cool with that.

## Random tables

There's a few random tables in this adventure, but as in any adventure, you don't have to roll. If you see a choice that's more interesting than the others in the moment, you can just pickt that.

## Death

When the character reaches 0 hp, they are knocked out, and wake up in either the [[Prison Coil]] or, if the player has been having a particularly hard time, at [[Orm Outpost]].

If the player can handle character death without it being upsetting, you can just have them die.
